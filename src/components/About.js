        		<p>January 2019, I was a Bitly Wintern [A winter intern, hehe, do you get it?].<br /><br />

        		Throughout my time at Bitly I had the opportunity to explore frontend web development.<br />
        		Previous to my experience at Bitly I did not enjoy web development. Working with javascript 🤮, angular, ew.<br />
			But, I have come to appreciate web development, in a new light, in a typescript + react 😍 light.<br />
        		Thank you to Vic, Zee, Kevin, and my Wintern crew [Shannon, Lubna, Aisha, and Michelle], whoop whoop 🙌🏾<br /><br />
        		Because of all of you, WebVR projects wIlL b3 iN mY fUtURe!!<br /><br />
			</p>
			<p>Fun fact, I built this site using React 😬</p>
